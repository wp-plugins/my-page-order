1. Extract zipped mypageorder folder
2. Upload the mycategoryorder folder to /wp-content/plugins/ on your server.
3. Activate the My Page Order plugin on the Plugins menu.
4. Plugin tab appears under the Manage menu, give the pages an initial order.
5. Make sure your templates have the correct sort parameter, see below.

Sort attribute

In your templates (accessible through the theme editor or downloading the file off the server) 
there might be several places your list of pages gets outputed. To use your sort order each 
instance must have the sort column argument set like the following:

    wp_list_pages(’sort_column=menu_order’);
